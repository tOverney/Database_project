\subsection{Table creation}
    We will implement the next deliverables using our own server with PostGreSQL.
    As such the types used in the following CREATE TABLE possibly doesn't work well in an
    Oracle DB environnement.

\subsection{Discussion about constraint}
    A person can have one or more alternative name but an alternative name can describe only one person. We thus have a one-to-many relationship set. Also if the person is deleted from the database, his alternative names (if any) will be too. We thus created a weak entity for alternative name.
    We applied the same design choice for two similar situations: the production and its alternative title(s) and the tv serie and its episode(s). \\
    
    A production cast make the connection between the production, the person and the character (if any). We thus made a ternary relationship between the three entity person, character and production. We add the role of the person as an attribute of the relationship set. A character exist only if related to at least one person and one production. The person and production entity don't have this constraint since a production can have only a director that won't have any character.  \\
    
    Companies can be involved into production. They can play roles of different type (for example production, distribution), thus we added an attribute to the relationship "participate" called type instead of having a lot of duplicated entries in the "Company" table. Since that design choice, the data set given has been changed and comforted us in our design choice as the "type" attribute has been moved out of the COMPANY.csv file. A production need to have at least one company involved.\\
    
    We used enums for both the company type and the cast role because their value options are limited. As such we'll avoid repeating a considerable amount of bytes between the many lines sharing the same value for that field.\\
    
    And last but not least, instead of having a huge melting pot table called production, we made a "parent table" with all the fields shared between the different kinds of production and then we have a table per production kind which inherit from the production table and where some kind have additional info such as the season number in episode. This is the implementation of an IS A relationship in PostGreSQL. This allow us again to avoid having many entries of a table with some null field that they'd never have a value for.

\subsection{Grapical User Interface Design}

For the method to apply on a graphical user interface (GUI) allowing to query our movie database, we choose an opensource internet framework written in python, Django \footnote{Django Software Fondation, https://www.djangoproject.com}. The graphical design was focused on giving an open space to the user rather than a high-density function in a unique window.\\

Based on that, we design a main window with only the general search, meaning a text entry, a validation button and three radioboxes to specified what kind of search the user intend to do : by person, by movie or by casting. Once the user made a search, the results are display in a form of a list summarizing the informations retrieved from the database. The result window keeps the three general search components in case the user would want to adapt his search. We also add the possibility to recieve further informations on a part of the result by cliquing on it, this will in fact run a search query base on the type of the object of the user interest.\\

Then, to display the deliverable queries and their results, we used a menu list (comparable to an onglet system) to switch from the general search (default window) to the list of the deliverable queries (at the end 21 queries). Also here cliquing on one component of this list will trigger the associated SQL query and display the results in a new window to easily adapt the layout of the results. Indeed, the kind of results may diverge greatly from a unique row to several hundreds of them.
