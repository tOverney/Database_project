\section{Table creation}
    We will implement the next deliverables using our own server with PostGreSQL.
    As such the types used in the following CREATE TABLE possibly doesn't work well in an
    Oracle DB environnement.
    \begin{lstlisting}[
           language=SQL,
           showspaces=false,
           basicstyle=\ttfamily,
           autogobble=true,
           commentstyle=\color{gray}
        ]

        foreign key (pid) references Person(uid),
        ON DELETE CASCADE);
    
    CREATE TABLE Character

    CREATE TABLE Cast

        series_years CHAR (11),
        kind PROD_KIND NOT NULL,
        genre CHAR(20),

    CREATE TYPE COMPANY_TYPE AS ENUM ('distributors', 'production company');
    
    CREATE TABLE Participate

\section{Discussion about constraint}
    A person can have one or more alternative name but an alternative name can describe only one person. We thus have a one-to-many relationship set. Also if the person is deleted from the database, his alternative names (if any) will be too. We thus created a weak entity for alternative name.
    Same thing for the production that can have one or more alternative title, we created a weak entity for alternative title. \\
    
    A production cast make the connection between the production, the person and the character (if any). We thus made a ternary relationship between the three entity person, character and production. We add the role of the person as an attribute of the relationship set. A character exist only if related to at least one person and one production. The person and production entity don't have this constraint since a production can have only a director that won't have any character.  \\
    
    Companies can be involved into production. They can play roles of different type (for example production, distribution), thus we added an attribute to the relationship "participate" called type instead of having a lot of duplicated entries in the "Company" table. Since that design choice, the data set given has been changed and comforted us in our design choice as the "type" attribute has been moved out of the COMPANY.csv file. A production need to have at least one company involved.
