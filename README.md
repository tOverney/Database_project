# Database creation and webapp

This a relatively small database project (5 GB dataset) for which I had to:
  * design the data hierachy
  * design database structure
  * import dataset from uncleaned CSVs
  * write a list of required queries
  * design a webapp to have a nice interface.

This was done using python and the django framework.
