2. Explain the necessities of indexes (query plans)

Three indexes were used in this query: person_lastname_index, casting_perid_index and production_uid_index

The index on person.last_name is used in the WHERE clause. Index scan is used to find the rows matching
the index condition <last_name = 'Damon'>. Fetching the table rows in index order make them more expensive to 
read but there are so few that at the end it lower the reading cost. 
The "first_name" clause is applied as a filter on the rows retrieved by the index. Using a second index on "first_name" 
wasn't necessary since there was few output row from the first clause. It would have been more expensive to visit both 
index.

Then the index on casting.perid and on production.uid are used in the inner index scan of both LEFT JOIN 
clause. The use of index nested loop is best when having one relation is small and the other indexed. This is the case here: 
- <person.uid = casting.perid> : the resulted rows of person.uid are few because of the WHERE clause and there is an
  index on casting.perid.
- <casting.prodid> = production.uid: the resulted rows of casting.prodid are few because of the resulting left join and
  there is an index on production.uid. 


3. Report running time and explain the distribution of the cost based on the plans (???)

HashAggregate (count() + group by clause)

Nested Loop Join + index scan (2 left join)

Index scan + filtering (WHERE clause)

Limite + sorting (oder by clause)
